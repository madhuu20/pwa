# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's a two-player game, where each player takes turns to mark a square on the 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## How to Play

2. Player 1 will always start the game. Player 1 will be represented by the 'X' symbol, and Player 2 will be represented by the 'O' symbol.
3. Take turns to place your mark on the grid.
4. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all squares are filled and no player has won, then the game is a draw.
